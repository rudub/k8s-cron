This GitHub workflow is primarily focused on setting up a Minikube environment to remove unsed deployment from K8s with blue-green strategy, the github action performing below steps:
- deploying a Kubernetes resource
- executing a shell script and retrieving information about Kubernetes deployments
- Shell script executes and delete the k8s deployment based on active color deployment.
- It is triggered when changes are pushed to or a pull request is created for the "main" branch, and it can also be manually triggered through the GitHub Actions UI.
